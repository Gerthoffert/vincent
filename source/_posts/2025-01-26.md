Hello, today let me tell you about one of my favorite sport: Handball. I will tell you all my victorys and my friends, some of them are in my school. One of my favorite friend in my team is Malo and my second one is Lyam.

In this game you play in a team of 6 players inclouding the goally. I am not as strong as Malo, Raphael, Lucas and Pacôme but I am getting better an better thanks to the training that we have once a week. On top of that, we play against other teams every weekend. So far, our team has won only two games.

I scored a lot of times but the 2 best players for me are Malo and Raphaël.

At the game yesterday, I scored one of my best goal when my goally through me the ball, which I didn't catch, but at the last moment I pushed the ball with the back of my hand and it went over the goally and the ball went in. It was so funny.
